# output value, and add a docstring for users.

    Parameters
    ----------
    interval: int
        Amount of time in milliseconds to 
    limit: int or None
        Amount of refreshes to allow. If none, it will refresh infinitely.
        While infinite refreshes sounds nice, it will continue to utilize
        computing resources.
    debounce: boolean
        Whether to delay the autorefresh when user interaction occurs.
        Defaults to True in order to avoid refreshes interfering with
        interaction effects on scripts.
    key: str or None
        An optional key that uniquely identifies this component. If this is
        None, and the component's arguments are changed, the component will
        be re-mounted in the Streamlit frontend and lose its current state.

    -------
    int
        Number of times the refresh has been triggered or max value of int
